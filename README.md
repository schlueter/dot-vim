# .vim
My vim configuration. I set up this repository to more easily track my configuration across different machines and ease installation on new ones. The majority of the configuration here is (and will likely continue to be) borrowed from elsewhere. I will attempt to include attributions when possible. I've included vim-plug outright as it is my preferred plugin manager.
